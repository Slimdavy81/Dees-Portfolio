        <p class="large">The character and name Steve didn't come straight away. The Dualingo was a major influence on
          this process, they use a green bird and that steered me away from that concept in the beginning. The
          chameleon blending with the flag seemed like a nice fresh approach to a translating app. I think my real
          reasoning came for chosing the owl was not only for my love of the character from the Sword & the Stone but
          with the bird I had the opportunity to incorperate an animation sequence to add a fun engaging element for the
          user. The name to be fair was random, I ran through unusual names and thought Steve was the least likely you'd
          associate with this kind of application. It sounded fun. </p>
        <h2 id="Sketches">Early Sketches</h2>
        <img src="images/1.jpg" alt="Conceptualising">
        <p>I had the owl idea set in my mind but from my research with Smartwatch UI's I noticed alot of the elements
          were stat based. So I sketched out a few drawings to see how the bird would work with the extra elements.
          Making the bird the central focus or emphasisising the other elements was what I was orginally considering.
          I thought a daily quiz to learn words and phrases would be a nice aspect. My lecturer then told me
          to simplify this and just make it a translation app. I thought this could work both ways. With a companion
          mobile app recording all your words and phrases, you not only got the translations but got to learn the
          languages with your recordings.
        </p>

        <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="character poses">

        <p>These sketches were obviosly drawn before I decided on taking the quiz element out. At this stage I was
          leaning more on giving the character a little personality with didderent poses for the various aspects of the
          application.</p>

        <p>I was given the idea of the bird flying into the foreground and you press on it for the translation.
          This got me thinking of the Interface again and instead of him just flying around the screen, I thought him
          waking up from sleeping on a tree and landing on the forground would work well. The top left bird seemed like
          he was listening in, this seemed like the perfect pose for him after landing. For the translation process an
          hour glass turning was suggested to me but I thought the owl looking up a book would be a nicer fit. For
          the recording aspect I thought an audio spectrum was perfect, It was from this I got the moon idea. The
          Bauhaus typeface was really just a placeholder at this stage.</p>
        <h2 id="Animation">Animation</h2>
        <img src="images/flydown.png" alt="flydown">
        <p>This is were the fun began, waking the bird from the tree and having him fly to the foreground. This was a
          bit of a challenge, fortunately I had previously created a simple bird animation and simply adjusted the
          perspective and cut the the keyframes I didnt need.</p>

        <img src="images/SmartwatchUI.jpg" alt="User Interface">
        <p>I knew with the timeframe I wouldn't be able to create the app exactly the way I wanted it. After I received
          the feedback I discovered there were extra elements in my UI that could have been removed. The Volume bar on
          the
          left could have been used on just the home page, the battery life meter at the bottom did'nt need to be there
          at all and the audio sprectrum on the right (an element I thought would have worked with the quiz aspect
          showing the level of difficulty) was also something I could have also removed. Aesthetically I think they
          bring the UI together nicely but they really don't serve any meaningful purpose. If I removed them It would
          have freed up space to enlarge the elements you do actually use and make it a much more legible Interface.</p>

        </p>
        <p>With this being a speculative design. I wanted it to be more than just a translating app. I was set from the
          beginning on this being an application much like Dualingo...educational. With the archive of the multiple
          translations I felt this would be a great way to learn your chosen language more efficently. I tried to keep
          the Interface as simple as possible using the same colour palette from the watch UI. Chosing 'Item' for the
          typeface was a case of finding a simple font that was fun and legible.</p>
